TapeMouse
=========

Tape + Mouse = TapeMouse

Don't use this on a server that doesn't allow AFK farming.
It is detectable, and I'm not planning on making it undetectable.

How to use
----------

Use /tapemouse <off|name of keybind> <key down delay> <key up delay>
Use /tapemouse with no arguments to get a list of keybind names you can use
